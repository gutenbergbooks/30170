<h2>By RUSS WINTERBOTHAM</h2>

<div class="bk2">Illustrated by Kelly Freas</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap"><i>I</i>t seems</span> unnecessary to say
that my story began a long time
ago, but I do not intend to be
subtle. I am not clever and my lying
is unpolished, almost amateurish.
So I certainly could not be
subtle, which requires both cleverness
and an ability to tell the truth
and a lie in the same breath.</p>

<p>Let us turn back the clock a few
ages. I was lying in the sun thinking
of love. I understand that you
human beings have an aversion to
biological discussion, so I will not
go into detail. But I must remind
you that my love life is quite different
from yours, for I am from
another planet. At the time under
discussion, I was most deeply in
love.</p>

<p>My heart's desire had no shape,
the lovely creature. She had no intelligence,
the divine soul. But she
was the greatest bit of protoplasm
in any galaxy you could name. By
our standards, I probably might be
called handsome. I was young and
healthy. I had all of my genes and
chromosomes. My color was the
dirty green that is associated with
beauty.</p>

<p>The sun warmed my body and
the tidal undulation of my planet's
surface rocked me gently. And
then she came into my life. She
floated gently in the breeze, her
dainty figure held aloft by a mere
hint of levitation. Sparks of static
electricity shot from her tender cilia
so brightly that I was forced to exude
a layer of protective fibre to
protect my visual buds. She sucked
a deep breath of cyanic gas into her
pulmonary pouch and spoke to me
sweetly with a voice like distant
thunder.</p>

<p>"My dear Yljm, the world is
coming to an end."</p>

<p>I could not believe her, for she
had no intelligence. She only loved
to talk. "Perhaps," I said, "but not
today."</p>

<p>"Very soon, then," said she. Her
name was Mjly.</p>

<p>I watched her with patronizing
amusement. The static electricity
showed that she was nervous and
upset, but people often get nervous
and upset over trivial matters.
"Now, how," I reasoned, "could our
world come to an end? The other
planet has gone on for thousands
of years without colliding with us.
We circle it, in fact."</p>

<p>"No," Mjly said, "that is not our
doom. Actually our world will not
cease to exist. Life will end here,
that is all."</p>

<p>"Ah," I said. "Our atmosphere
is escaping into space." I sucked air,
viciously. True, the air was thin.
True, the atmosphere was escaping.
But there would be breathable
amounts for many thousands of
centuries yet to come.</p>

<p>"Not the air. The food is all
gone. Things we eat have ceased to
exist."</p>

<p>I levitated myself and looked out
over the throbbing land. A few
years ago, this land had been covered
with vegetation. I had come
to take vegetation so much for
granted that I'd ceased to notice it.
Now it was gone. There were no
round fruits growing from tender
grasses, no tubers dangling from
the fungus trees, no legume vines
sprawling over the rocks. Everywhere
lay desert, barren dunes
shaking their crests with tidal motion.</p>

<p>I lowered myself to the ground
and dug my big fibrosities into
the sod. No green leaves grew
there beneath the surface. The soil
was dead. "This will seriously interfere
with our future, Mjly," I said.</p>

<p>"We might eat each other," she
replied, "but then there would be
no one left."</p>

<p>"No one? There are many
others here."</p>

<p>"The others are dying," said
Mjly, blinking her otic nerves
eerily. "We soon will be the only
ones left."</p>

<p>It was indeed a senseless thing to
do, to die just because there was no
means of going on living. But I
must admit that I was tempted for
a moment. But I hung onto myself,
for there was Mjly, and as long
as she lived, there was a reason for
me to live too.</p>

<p>"It's not a cheerful prospect," I
said, "but I suppose death by starvation
is the best way out. We will
face death as we have lived, cheerfully
and fortuitously."</p>

<p>"And why should we die, when
there is another world so close?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Are you suggesting interplanetary
flight, my dear?" I was amused
again, even though there was little
enough left to be amused at.</p>

<p>She crinkled her sense of smell
in reply, and I realized I was not
being amused at the right time.
Anchoring herself by magnetic
processes, she began to weave the
atmosphere delicately with her
taste-bud tendrils. Quickly she hollowed
the air molecules into a reflective
mirror, and brought it to
focus on our neighboring world. I
levitated myself into a position so
that I could look into the mirror.</p>

<p>The near planet was quite satisfactory.
It was the one you know as
the earth. It was young. It was
green. Huge fern-like plants grew
abundantly on its surface. It was
full of food. And near.</p>

<p>"The trip could be made by levitation,"
Mjly said.</p>

<p>I hung back. "Animals might
live there. We'd be devoured."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she said.</p>

<p>"We might not get hungry for a
time. Let us linger here awhile.
Later when we get desperate, there
will be time enough for interplanetary
flight." I hated the thought
of stuffing myself full of air enough
to last for the long trip.</p>

<p>Mjly lowered her visual buds. "I
am going to become a mother,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Go then, and become a mother.
I'll stay here till I get hungry and
then join you."</p>

<p>Mjly unflexed her sense of touch
and I felt sorry for her. "If I could
be sure," I said, "that no wild animals
live on the earth, I'd go sooner."</p>

<p>She snapped her sense of balance
in happiness. "I will go first,"
said she. "If everything is pleasant
and safe, I will return and let you
know."</p>

<p>I nodded my otic nerves and off
she went.</p>

<p>As you human beings are doubtless
aware, space levitation is quite
complicated, but not beyond accomplishment.
Once you are able
to reach the speed of escape the
rest is easy. But Mjly was young
and strong and soon she had disappeared
from sight traveling at a
tremendous velocity. I followed her
as long as I could with the telescope
and then I lowered myself to
the tidal crest of a nearby sand
dune and lost myself in metaphysical
thoughts.</p>

<p>Almost half a year later I realized
that Mjly had been gone longer
than I expected. Either she had
been eaten by wild animals on the
earth, or she had forgotten me.</p>

<p>I was beginning to get lonesome
and in a few more months I would
get hungry. At the thought of enduring
two such excruciating pains
at a single time, I decided to risk
my life. I would travel through
space to the earth and try to find
my beloved.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, the
planet on which we had been living
is the one you now know as the
Moon, and the distance to the earth
is comparatively small. The sand dunes
now have hardened and the
tidal sway of its surface can be felt
only slightly. The moon no longer
turns on its axis and it has no sweetly
scented cyanide in its atmosphere.
It has no atmosphere of any
sort. But it stands now as it did
when I left it, glorious in death.
Since I departed, no living thing
has trod its soil.</p>

<p>My scientific sense instinctively
came to the rescue as I approached
the earth. I felt a strong gravity
wrenching at my vitals and so instead
of trying reverse levitation, I
spread my processes so that the atmosphere
caught in the folds of my
skin and I came floating gently
down to the ground without harm.</p>

<p>The earth was much as it had
appeared through the molecule
telescope. It was covered with green
vegetation, good, rich, nourishing
stuff. And there was enough to feed
Mjly and me for a million years.</p>

<p>There were no animals of any
sort. Again I went to my scientific
sense for the answer. I realized that
while vegetable life was far advanced,
animal life had yet to appear.
Mjly was the first of this type
of life ever to set foot on terrestrial
soil.</p>

<p>But where was she? On the
moon, I could often locate her a
thousand miles away by a simple
radio call. Although the earth was
much larger than the moon, I did
not doubt that she was within a
thousand miles. So I generated
power and issued a call.</p>

<p>I waited for the response. It
came feebly to my antenna.</p>

<p>Using my sense of direction, I
pushed through the vegetation in
search of her. I did not levitate,
because the feebleness of her call
indicated she might be hurt and on
the ground. Besides, levitation is
much more difficult on the earth
than on the moon.</p>

<p>The reply came stronger to my
next call and I sensed through
seven of my senses that she was
near. She was on the ground, probably
injured, which explained why
she had not returned as she had
promised.</p>

<p>I came to a patch of wilderness,
a great marshy plain. In the middle
of this swamp was a crater, like
those caused by meteors, a deep,
ugly scar in the mud. I shuddered
at the thought that my darling Mjly
might have landed there. Her
weaker scientific sense might not
have given her the cue to use her
skin as a parachute and she might
have made the fatal mistake of trying
to reverse-levitate.</p>

<p>"Mjly!" I called, speaking aloud
now. "Mjly! Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Yljm! I am here!"</p>

<p>Yes, the voice came from the
crater. Gliding to its rim, I looked
down. A pool of water lay on the
bottom. A greenish scum covered
the surface. The scum moved with
a million tiny wriggles.</p>

<p>"Yes, Yljm," came Mjly's voice.
"It is I. But I am no longer one
being." And her voice sounded like
a million tiny chirps joined together.
"I landed with such force that I
came apart. Now each of my body
cells lives a life of its own. And now
and then each cell grows fat and
becomes two. I am my sisters, I ..."</p>

<p>Let's not be subtle about it. Mjly
was a microbe, the beginning of
animal life on the earth. She lives
today, she is and always will be her
sisters, her mothers, herselves and
her ancestors. But there are few
ancestors, for microbes do not die&mdash;just
part of themselves die.</p>

<p>And I do not die. For I crept
away into a hole in the ground,
where I will live forever. I do not
starve, for roots reach me here. But
I miss my love life with Mjly. I can
never be a mother or a sister. I will
always be me, a lonesome old bem.</p>
